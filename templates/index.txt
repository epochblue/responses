responses
=========

responses is a tool used for returning canned JSON responses.

{% if routes -%}
The configured routes are:

    {% for route in routes -%}
    * {{ route }}
    {% endfor -%}

{% else -%}
To create canned responses, create a responses.yaml file (you can find an example
in the `example` directory included with this project) and place it in the root
of the project. This page will display configured routes, if any are found.
